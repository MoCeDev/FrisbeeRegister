My first project working with a database.

There is a interface with CRUD function for you disc golfs.
Start the program and follow the instructions displayed in terminal.

You can add disc golfs into database. Program will show what disc golf you have added during current session into database.
You can Read all your data from database, or look for specific data.
You can update your disc data, if you misstyped information in columns.
You can also delete your disc from the database.
